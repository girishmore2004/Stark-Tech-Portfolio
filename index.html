                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Tony Stark is a genius, billionaire, and philanthropist. He not only invented the Iron Man Armor, but wears the suit himself. He is a resourceful co-leader and one of the founding members of the Avengers. He is the CEO of Stark Industries, which once sold highly sophisticated weapons systems technologies to government defense organizations such as S.H.I.E.L.D. who uses them to maintain peace and order. However, he has pulled his company away from the weapons business after seeing the damage they caused. Combining their genius, Tony and Yinsen built a mighty suit of iron armor that would be dubbed Iron Man. This first suit left a lot of room for improvement, but it still did what Tony couldn’t do.<br><strong>"My armor, it was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. But one thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man." ―Tony Stark</strong></p>
